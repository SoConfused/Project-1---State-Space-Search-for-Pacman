In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a
particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and
apply them to Pacman scenarios.

Files you'll edit:

search.py Where all of your search algorithms will reside.

Files you might want to look at:

pacman.py The main file that runs Pacman games. This file describes a Pacman Game State type, which you use in this project.

game.py The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like Agent State, Agent, Direction, and Grid.

util.py Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms.

searchAgents.py A variety of different types of Pacman agents.
